    <p>Introduction
        At the outset, web designing emerged as an easier and simple way of exchanging information. It was a better means of communication and had better networking benefits compared to the commercial reasons. Later on, the Web became an avenue for making profits, and the information space that was prior for providing free exchange thus changed to a space for commercial transactions.
        
        The open source movement first emerged when major players met and decided to begin the initiative of licensing to protect software developers. The movement was therefore a licensing measure meant to make source codes available to others beside the author through leasing.
        
        There was also need to allow programmers to distribute their software freely and enable people to modify source codes. The current web-based software developers such as PHP, Firefox, WordPress and Linux are thus major contributors to development of modern websites. Open source has consequently had a direct influence on web development and browsing such as flexibility and innovative development initiatives in addition to providing network solutions History
        Development of ‘open source’ receives very little attention especially official concerns by the initial founders for its development. The initial organizations to benefit from the open licensing systems directly included the Department of Defence (DOD), Research Agencies, and the Lab researchers such as National Laboratories (Reece et al, 92). These organizations were the most viable producers, users and beneficiaries of the licensing operation.
        
        The firms also provided the platform for major advances such as the firewalls, and other network security tools. Open licensing therefore caused firms to merge ideas and integrate development of operating systems and related software to high-tech but inexpensive software/hardware supercomputers to replace the original Pentium-based systems.
        
        Although departments such as the DOD or Space Agencies may have developed or initiated most of the research into open source, in overall, today’s beneficiaries include commercial agencies. Commercial enterprises such as Netscape, Red Hat, Cygnus, MacAfee and Caldera were quick to realize the opportunities offered by web-based methodologies and begun to offer the open source arrangements.
        
        Other firms that latter on came in support of open source included the hardware developers such as Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq, Sun Microsystems and IBM (International Business Machines) among others. Consistent with VanDyk, the concept open source emerged from software engineers, but today the entire movement is made of technologically motivated individuals (9). They focus more on technological productivity as opposed to economical benefits.</p>

<h2><b>WEB DESIGN</b></h2>
<p>The Basics of Web Design

    Web Design is the process of creating, making, and developing websites. It includes many different features such as webpage layout, webpage content, and also graphic designs. In general web design and web development work together, but the term web design is an actual category of web development. The main way of creating websites is building it from scratch using HTML language; which stands for Hypertext markup language. Web designers build websites using HTML tags that define the content of each page. The layout of the webpage and the appearance of all the elements will be built by using CSS; which stands for Cascading Style sheets. Therefore, all of the websites are being of combination of HTML and CSS files to define of how the page going to appear to the client or user. Many web designers prefer to build a web page starting from scratch by typing HTML and CSS codes, and others they prefer using a software for building and designing these webpages. Some of these soft wares to build and design websites are Dream Weaver which is mostly being used on MAC operating system or WordPress and Joomla which makes it easier for the web designer to design the webpage using the templates that these software already have listed, when the designer choose which template to use the software will automatically build the HTML and CSS files to create that template which also saves time and energy of writing those codes. In the following we going to point out the basics of web designing by using HTML and CSS files and show the steps to create HTML template, heading tags, HTML lists, create paragraphs and break tags, create CSS file, CSS rules, Font sizes, color, style, and adding images, hyperlinks, and CSS layouts.

The use of ID Selectors is the same exact way of using the Class Selectors, but rather than typing Class just type ID.
    
    Overall, the main language is used for modern webpages are the HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascade Style Sheet.) Both of these languages are important in web design. Learning how to use these two languages will make it easy for the development team to build, design, and develop a website. What we mentioned above was the basics of web designing, which a brief summary of the basics of codes to design a webpage. This topic covers a lot of information after getting used to typing the codes; it will get easier for the designer to use both of the languages.</p>
